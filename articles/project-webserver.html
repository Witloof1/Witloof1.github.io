      <h1>Project: hosting my own website</h1>

      <p>Recently I decided to step up my game and create my personal website. Aimed at introducing myself towards companies and interested people, I envisioned a clean and modern site. To give myself an extra challenge, I decided to host the site myself. Unbekownst to me, chaos was about to ensue.</p>

      <h3>Calm before the storm</h3>
      <p>I decided to buy myself a Raspberry Pi. A cheap microcontroller with networking capabilities seemed the perfect fit. But wait ... Didn't I have an old Macbook Air lying in one of my closets? Aha! Now I even didn't need to pay for hardware. I can just host my website on that old Macbook Air. Just install Debian on that <i>damn thang</i> and we're all set.</p>
      <h3>The chaos</h3>
      <p>I downloaded the ISO image, found an old USB stick, downloaded Balena-Etcher and I was on my way to create a bootable USB. <i>God darn it</i>, flash failed. The first part of the chaos. Okay, try it again. Still failed. Try another USB? Still failed. Reformat USB, reinstall Balena-Etcher? Still nothing. Eventually I just ditched Balena-Etcher altogheter. After trying - and failing - with Ubuntu's <i>Startup Disk Creator</i>, I found a terminal command, tried it, and it <i>magically</i> worked.</p>
      <p>Okay, an hour wasted already, but let's just move on, we're almost there. I booted from the USB and followed the installer.
      <i>"No Ethernet card detected. If you know the name of the driver needed by your Ethernet card, you can select it from the list."</i>
      Uh-oh... I don't know what Ethernet card I have, and moments later I realised the one I should have wasn't even in the list. Let's just skip that part for now.
      </p>
      <p>After some waiting Debian was installed. But, of course, there was no internet connection. Installing packages is quite difficult without connection and hosting a website even impossible. I knew what I had to do, but I didn't know if I had the strength to do it. The difficult task ahead of me was to painstakingly download the driver packages and all its dependencies via one device onto a USB, mount the USB on the Macbook Air, and install the packages from that USB. Using apt-rdepends doing this seemed surprisingly easy. Or so it seemed. After the first try, a number of dependencies failed to install, ultimately resulting in the driver package failing to install.
      What followed was a tedious fight against a dependency hell. Numerous trips of my USB From my laptop to the Macbook Air and working on a system that even didn't have vim, but vi. Those were the consequences of choosing to host a website on a Debian installation on a Macbook Air.

      <p>Hours were wasted in that battle, but I prevailed. Triumph was ahead of me. Finally, I had an internet connection.
      Nginx and cerbot were installed, and the rest is history. The result is a dusty and old - but more than capable - Macbook Air serving you this page. You're welcome.

      <p><i>Update: the website is now no longer self-hosted, because my father unplugged the cable.</i><p>
